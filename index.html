    <h1>About Us</h1> 
    <p>We believe that there is nothing more relaxing than a river trip. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. For us, this means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.

    <p> That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
